# PentiaMessageApp

Pentia development task in relation to internship application

The app is only build to run on android!

Start app by running npm start in project root

open android folder and run react-native run-android. You can run it on an emulator or your own device

# Notes: 
The .js files for my implementation can be found in the "pages" folder

The ImageLoader.js file does not do anything. I tried implementing functionality to upload images,
but since i run the app on an emulator because i don't have an android, i could not use the photo gallery.
The photo gallery needed an update, which my emulator could not install. The ImageLoader.js file is just there for reference

The video showing the push functionality can be fond in "pages/NotificationCheck.mp4"
